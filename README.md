Tri- Colour LEDs:

There are two types of RGB led’s; the common cathode one and the common anode one. In the common cathode RGB led, the cathode of all the led’s is common and we give PWM signals to the anode of led’s while in the common anode RGB led, the anode of all the led’s is common and we give PWM signals to the cathode of led’s. The RGB led has one big lead than the other leads. In the common cathode case, it will be connected to GND and in the common anode case; it will be connected to 5V.


Using Arduino Uno connecting 3 potentiometers and RGB LED to port pins of microcontroller. Changing the colour of RGB based on the change in voltage of potentiometers.
